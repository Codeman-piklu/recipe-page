What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design and semantic HTML. Below are some highlights:
- Example: Semantic HTML
<section class="instructions">
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Beat the eggs with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Cook in a non-stick pan with butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Fold and serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
</section>
 - Example: CSS for Responsiveness
.recipe {
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1rem;
}


### Continued development
- Accessibility: Add aria-labels and improve screen reader navigation.
- Interactivity: Use JavaScript to toggle visibility for optional sections (e.g., nutritional facts).
- Styling: Experiment with animations or transitions to enhance user experience.

### Useful resources

- Frontend Mentor Guides - A great place to find tools and tutorials.
- MDN Web Docs - For understanding semantic HTML and CSS best practices.
